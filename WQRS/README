Step 1: WFDB INSTALLATION AND WQRS COMPILATION

This application is used for benchmarking a variety of platform e.g MSP430, Coolflux, ATmega, etc. that
are used for low-power wireless devices. To get the application compiled and running the following 
items are required:

WQRS benchmark: http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wag/wqrs-1.htm
WFDB package: http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml

First download and install the WFDB package on your computer. Make sure to download the source files of 
the package (http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.tar.gz). Read the INSTALL file in the package to 
for more details. Note: Use the dynamic link option during configuration and install the package in your 
home directory.

Second, set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH with the path to the WFDB library e.g. 
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /imecnl/users/bouwens/wfdb/lib/  

Finally, the compilation can be done with: 
gcc -o wqrs wqrs.c -I<full_path_wfdb_include> -L<full_path_wfdb_library> -lwfdb -lm

For Example:
gcc -o wqrs wqrs.c -I/imecnl/users/bouwens/wfdb/include -L/imecnl/users/bouwens/wfdb/lib/ -lwfdb -lm

Step 2: RUNNING THE WQRS APPLICATION

The input of the application comes from the Physionet database. The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database 
(http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/) is selected for benchmarking, however the sampling
frequency is 360Hz insteadof 200Hz. This requires an option of the application. Only the MLII lead is 
used for this as well, but this requires modification.

Let assume the databases are stored in MITDB in the database folder of the WFDB package. The wqrs
benchmark is executed as:

./wqrs -r MITDB/100 -p 100 -R

Where "-p 100" and -R results in a resampling at 200Hz.

This will create a MITDB folder in the execution folder with the output named "100.wqrs". To varify the
output the application "bxb" in the WFDB package can be used. Copy it to this folder and execute:

./bxb -r MITDB/100 -a atr wqrs

To see the output of the wqrs benchmark in text copy the application "rdann" in the WFDB package to this
folder as well. The output is visualized by:

./rdann -a wqrs -r MITDB/100
